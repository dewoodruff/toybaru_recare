# Toybaru ReCare

A self-hosted dashboard for the Subaru Solterra and Toyota bZ4X that gives you full access to your own driving data -- the data that Subaru and Toyota collect but never show you. Supports both **EU** (Subaru) and **NA** (Toyota) regions, including OTP/2FA authentication.

## Why this exists

I built this because Subaru silently deleted all my trip data from 2024. One day it was there, the next it was gone. No warning, no export option, no backup. Almost a year of driving history, just wiped from their servers.

That pissed me off enough to start poking around the SubaruConnect API. What I found was surprising: the API collects far more data than the app ever shows you. For every single trip, Subaru tracks:

- **Overspeed logging** -- every point on your route where you exceeded the speed limit is flagged with `overspeed: true`. Subaru knows exactly where and when you were speeding. This is never shown in the app.
- **Driving behaviour events** -- every hard brake, every aggressive acceleration is logged with GPS coordinates, timestamps, severity scores, and even road gradient. The app shows you a vague "driving score" but never the raw events.
- **Driving mode per route point** -- every few meters, the car records whether you were in Eco, Power, or Regeneration mode. The full route is reconstructed with mode-colored segments.

None of this is visible in the Subaru Care app. Your car is basically a telemetry device on wheels, and you have no access to your own data.

So I built a dashboard around it. Import your trips, store them locally (so Subaru can't delete them again), browse your routes on a map, see where you braked hard, check your efficiency stats, and export everything as CSV or JSON.

- PKCE S256 for OAuth2 authorization code flow
- JWT signature verification via ForgeRock JWKS
- Sanitized error messages (detailed errors logged server-side only)
- XSS hardening (textContent for dynamic content, no inline handlers with user data)
- Security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy)
- Rate limiting on login, OTP, and vehicle command endpoints
- Session expiry with automatic cleanup
- VIN format validation
- Docker container runs as non-root user

**Toyota NA Region Support**
- Full Toyota North America API integration alongside existing Subaru EU
- Automatic endpoint and header adaptation per region

- Unit display adapts to region (miles for NA, km for EU)

**Multi-language**
- Ships with German (de) and English (en)
- Add more languages by dropping a JSON file into the locales directory
- Language switcher dropdown, preference saved in browser

**Multi-vehicle**
- Vehicle switcher in the top bar

- Works if your account has multiple vehicles linked

## Installation

### Docker (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/youruser/toybaru.git
cd toybaru
docker compose up -d
```

Open http://localhost:8099, sign in with your Subaru or Toyota account credentials. Toyota NA users will be prompted for an OTP code delivered via email.

Your data is stored in a Docker volume (`toybaru-data`). It persists across container restarts and rebuilds.

### Local (Python)

Requires Python 3.10+.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/youruser/toybaru.git
cd toybaru
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install .
toybaru dashboard
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:8099.

Alternatively, you can use the CLI directly:

```bash
toybaru login -r EU
toybaru vehicles
toybaru status <VIN>
toybaru battery <VIN>
toybaru trips <VIN> --from 2025-01-01 --json
toybaru import-trips <VIN> --from 2024-06-01
toybaru trip-stats
toybaru raw GET /v2/vehicle/guid
```

### Environment variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `TOYBARU_DATA_DIR` | `~/.config/toybaru` | Directory for databases, tokens, and config |
| `TOYBARU_SECURE_COOKIES` | `false` | Set to `true` to require HTTPS for session cookies (auto-detected if behind a reverse proxy with `X-Forwarded-Proto: https`) |

## Configuration

### Region config

The tool ships with EU (Europe) and NA (North America) configurations. These are the API endpoints, client IDs, and authentication realms needed to talk to the Subaru/Toyota backend.

To override or add regions, create a `regions.json` file in your data directory:

```bash
# Docker
docker compose cp regions.example.json toybaru:/data/regions.json

# Local
cp regions.example.json ~/.config/toybaru/regions.json
```

Edit the file to change values. You only need to include the fields you want to override -- missing fields fall back to the built-in defaults. See `regions.example.json` for the full structure.

### Adding a language

Create a new JSON file in `src/toybaru/locales/`, for example `fr.json`:

```json
{
  "_meta": {
    "locale": "fr-FR",
    "label": "Francais"
  },
  "app": {
    "name": "Toybaru ReCare",
    ...
  }
}
```

Use `en.json` as a template. The language will appear automatically in the dropdown after restarting the server.

## First steps after installation

1. Open the dashboard and sign in with your Subaru or Toyota account (same credentials as the SubaruConnect / Toyota app)
2. Toyota NA users: enter the OTP code sent to your email (check spam/junk folder -- codes come from `donotreply@toyotaconnectedservices.com` for Toyota or `noreply@subaruconnectedservices.io` for Subaru)
3. **EU users:** Go to the **Data** tab, set the "From" date to when you got your car and click **Start import**
4. Wait for the import to finish (about 1 minute per 100 trips)
5. Go to **Trips** to browse your data, **Statistics** for the overview
6. **NA users:** Trip and charging history data is not available from Toyota's API. The Vehicle tab shows battery, status, location, and remote controls.

After the initial import, use the **Fetch new trips** button on the Trips tab to pull only the latest data.

## Important notes

- **Tested on a 2023 Subaru Solterra (EU/Germany) and a Toyota bZ4X (NA/US).** Other regions may work but are untested. Feedback welcome.
- **Toyota NA uses OTP via email for authentication.** The codes arrive from `donotreply@toyotaconnectedservices.com` (Toyota) or `noreply@subaruconnectedservices.io` (Subaru) and may land in your spam folder.
- **Toyota NA does not provide trip or charging history data.** Neither trip logs nor charging session history are available through Toyota's North America API. The Trips, Statistics, and Data tabs are automatically hidden for NA users. Only vehicle status, battery, location, and remote controls are available.
- **Subaru deletes trip data after approximately 12 months.** This is why local storage matters. Import your data regularly.
- **The API does not provide kWh consumption per trip.** The endpoints for energy data exist but return 403 (Forbidden) for the Subaru API client.
- **Remote commands are fire-and-forget.** The car needs to wake up to process them, which can take 15-60 seconds. Not all commands may be supported by your vehicle -- available commands vary by model and region.
- **No official API documentation exists.** This project is based on reverse-engineering the mobile apps and community research (see Credits).

## Running tests

```bash
pip install -e ".[test]"
pytest tests/ -v
```

## Contributing

This project is tested with one car in one country. If you have a Solterra or bZ4X in a different region and want to help, contributions are welcome:

- Verify and fix region configurations for other markets (Japan, Australia, etc.)
- Add translations (just create a new JSON file in `src/toybaru/locales/`)
- Report what works and what doesn't on your vehicle
- Help discover additional Toyota NA API endpoints (trips, charging history)
